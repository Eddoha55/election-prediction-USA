# US presidential election of 2016

In this project, our objective was to predict the winner (Republican or Democrats) in each county based on demographics.

We used a dataset from Kaggle available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/2016-us-election).

In the end we reached a perfect score with a Random Forest algorithm and a score almost as good with an XGBoost algorithm.
